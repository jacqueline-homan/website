		<h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
			<p>
				<strong><em>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</em></strong> is a leader in the movement to teach
	      		technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
	      		command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
	      		everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
	      		Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
	      		We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
	      		learning <em>technical sophistication</em>, probably more. To join our
	      		movement, <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">sign up for our official email list</a> now.

		<h2>Background</h2>

		<h2>Founders</h2>
			<p>
			      Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
			      Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
			      sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
			      at <strong>least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.
		    </p>
		<h3>Michael Hartl</h3>
			<p>
		          Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">
		          Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
		          <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
		          introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
		          <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
		          plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
		          are slightly exaggerated.
    		</p>
		<h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
			<p>
				When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
          		on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
          		interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
          		interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
			</p>
		<h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

			<p>
				You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
          		Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
          		at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
          		tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
